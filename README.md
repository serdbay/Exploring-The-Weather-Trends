## General Information
In this data analysis we will analyze and explore the weather trends between Istanbul' s average temperatures and global world average temperatures based on the years.

We will create visualizations and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Istanbul.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.5

## Setup
Before starting this project you need to download the weather data of Istanbul and Global Average Temperature that is our weather_data.csv file. 

## Usage
In this project we calculated so many different aspects of the relationships of the weather trends between Istanbul and Global temperature. You can check the correlation between the weather trends and can use this template for you another weather temperature based projects.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the global warming. When I first saw some aftermaths of global warming, I would like to do a project like this. That's why I tried to answer some questions based on global warming and Istanbul in my project.
